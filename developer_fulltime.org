* About us

Weâ€™re a small bootstrapped company based in Berlin and Brandenburg with a diverse team. Our backgrounds vary, ranging from mathematics and robotics, to AI/Machine Learning and medicine.
For our current product we received funding to build a software system to help health care professionals in hospitals use medical data in a more effective way, and in the future to actively help shape the treatment process.
The backbone of this system is a data- and database-editor in the browser.

The company's founders are mostly technical and we try our best to let developers spend most of their time developing.
We value pragmatic solutions and take the time to write good code, but try to not overengineer things.
Solutions are usually discussed and decided on together, but the details are left to whoever is responsible.
